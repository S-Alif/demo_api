    "question":"Can you use the useEffect hook with an empty array as the second argument in React ?",
    "explanation":"You can use the useEffect hook with an empty array as the second argument in React if the component has props.When the useEffect hook is called with an empty array as the second argument, it is only called once after the component is mounted.This is useful for performing actions that do not depend on the component's props or state."
